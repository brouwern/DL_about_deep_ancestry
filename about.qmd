Welcome to "Deep Learning about deep ancestry".  This website introduces you to the basics of how DNA sequences and machine learning can be used to characterize someone's ancestry.  The main landing page of the site contains a high-level overview, while additional sections of the site delve into how genomic data is processed and the machine learning algorithms use.

## Data Sources

These analyses rely on data from the **1000 Genomes Project** (1KGP).  The data provided by the ~2500 volunteers from throughout the world to the project 1KGP has been foundational to population genomics.  In these articles, I use 1KGP data that was augumented with additional samples by Xing, Jorde, and colleagues in their 2010 paper "[Toward a more uniform sampling of human genetic diversity: a survey of worldwide populations by high-density genotyping](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0888754310001552)", who have generously posted their [entire dataset](https://jorde.genetics.utah.edu/published-data/) online.

## Previous presentations

These articles are based on material from a course I taught at the University of Pittsburgh from 2020 to 2023, and a presentation at [PyOhio 2024](https://www.pyohio.org/2024/program/talks/23-python-and-me-using-machine-learning-in-python-to-analyze/).
